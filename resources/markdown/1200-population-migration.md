#  • Population Migration

Since 1990, 3% of the world's population immigrates every year. Another
8% would like to. Let's assume that:

* migrations only start with a group of a size roughly the Dunbar number
* that an initial migration will only occur if
    * the population grows so large that 2-12% of it is roughly the Dunbar number in
      size
    * a significant event occurs (e.g., fire, flood, disease, famine) that drives a
      greater percentage of the population into migration
    * a catastrophe occurs that drives 100% of the (surviving) population away from
      their home
    * once a migration starts, the presence of new resources and a doubling or
      tripling of the population causes the migration to bifurcate (or trifurcate)
    * that a settlement occurs only when a number of resource requirements are met,
      at which point the cycle will have to start over again (waiting for the population to support a Dunbar-sized group that is 2-12% of the settlement's
      population)

Resource evaluation during migration:

* presence of river, ocean, valuable natural resource
