#       • Carrying Capacity

The carrying capacity _K_ represents the ability of the environment to handle
a given population. In particular, the units are the same as _P_; it's value
is the maximum supported population.

When the population is greater than _K_, plots of the logistics equation
show an exponential decrease of the population over time. When the population
is less than _K_, plots show population growth asymptotic to the limit of _K_.
