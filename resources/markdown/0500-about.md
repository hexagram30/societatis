# About

From the perspective of an interactive, story-driven, world-oriented
adventure roll-playing game, the presence of a society is of critical
importance; ideally, two or more interacting societies are present. As a
story or game element, societies provide the following:

* a sensible context for characters, both playing and non-playing
* global, regional, municipal, and tribal backstory
* diversity of quests
* source of ample new supporting content for stories

A particular use case that motivated the creation of this project was
in-game news feeds. I grow weary of all the real-life bad news we see so
much of these days. I would love to open up a news reader in the morning
which drinking my coffee, and see what has been going on in a given
generated game world: a queen's new diplomatic achievement, an arcane
college discovering a new planar entity, the creation of a new village,
the founding of a new farm, the birth of twins to a tribe's leading
family, etc. Elements that would not only make for interesting or fun
news items to read about, but which would then be incorporated into
actual game-play, when I eventually logged in later in the day or week.

First things first, though: a society needs to be created! So, to
achieve the above desired usage, this project starts at the beginning
