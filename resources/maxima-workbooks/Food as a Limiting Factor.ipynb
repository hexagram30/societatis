    "Below is a collection of graphs from a paper by Gary Belovsky on population dynamics in hunter-gatherer societies, In particular, the four graphs examine population growth over hundreds of years, where a periods of increase and decline is approximately 90 years. The differences in the graphs are the grams nutrients per square meter available to the hunter-gather groups.\n",
